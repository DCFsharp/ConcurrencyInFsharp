FsGPU project contains library and samples to assist general purpose GPU programming in F# 
for CUDA enabled devices.

If you develop computationaly intensive applications, you will probably benefit 
from massive parallelization on CUDA devices. CUDA is a technology that can be used to 
harness full power of NVIDIA GPU device(s) installed on usual computer (server or desktop) 
for general purpose computations(GPGPU). Many applications can be parallelized using 
data-parallel algorithms and executed on CUDA enabled devices with performance increased 
in order of magnitude.

CUDA is a GPU computing library provided by NVIDIA Corp.
